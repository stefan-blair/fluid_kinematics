# fluid_kinematics

## synopsis
this project provides a tool for interacting with, visualizing and calculating vector fields relating to fluid kinematics.
given fields such as velocity, use the material derivative to derive the acceleration field, or even further.
visualize these vector fields using a variety of display options.
additionally, plot the path of particles with given start positions through the fields, using pathlines.
find the missing component of incomplete vector fields using the continuity equation.

## example
an example from main.py
```python
def main():
  return 1
```

## requirements
